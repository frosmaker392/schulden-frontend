# Schuldenverfolgung (Frontend)

This is the frontend project for my Bachelor's thesis on a software project for debt management. It is an Ionic Framework project and is built on top of the project generated by the Ionic CLI.

## Running the project

1. Define the required environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL`. It should point to the backend server's URL including the port number.
2. Run `ionic serve` in the project directory, but make sure that the Ionic CLI is installed.
3. The app should be opened in a browser window automatically. Otherwise, copy and paste the link given on the terminal on a browser window.
4. It is best to view the app on a phone or a simulated mobile display, which can be done via the developer tools of the browser being used.

## Commands

- `generate-types` - Generates type definitions from GraphQL documents and the schema. Should be stored under src/graphql/generated.ts.
